/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a service locator for lazy init proxies. When the first method invocation occurs on the lazy init proxy
 * this locator will be used to retrieve the proxy target object that will receive the method invocation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Generally implementations should be small when serialized because the main purpose of lazy init proxies is to be
 * stored in session when the wicket pages are serialized, and when deserialized to be able to lookup the dependency
 * again. The smaller the implementation of IProxyTargetLocator the less the drain on session size.
 * </p>
 * <p> 
 * A small implementation may use a static lookup to retrieve the target object.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 * 
 *
 * <pre>
 * class UserServiceLocator implements IProxyTargetLocator {
 *     Object locateProxyObject() {
 *         MyApplication app = (MyApplication) Application.get();
 *         return app.getUserService();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
